# List Name Search

The src/namelistsearch/ folder of this project contains two files.
- GirlsNames.txt – The top 200 girl names from 2000-2009  
- BoysNames.txt – The top 200 boy names from 2000-2009  


Create an application that reads the contents of the two files into two separate ArrayLists. 
The user should be prompted to enter a name. The program should display if the name was found in either 
or both lists (or neither) and the position in each list where it was found. 
Use the methods of the Collections Framework, Collections Class and Arraylist classes as needed.
Use full sentences in displaying the results to the user.

Note: Remember that humans count from one, programmers count from zero! Take that into consideration when reporting the position to the user.

### Primary Evaluation Criteria  

- 4 - Correctly loads names from the files into two lists
- 4 - Program displays the correct results
  - watch for ‘one-off’ errors
- 2 - General, compiles, comments, proper indentation, etc
