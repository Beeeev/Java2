# Duplicate Words
 
### Instructions:
- Create a program that reads words from a text file and displays all the non-duplicate words in ascending order.
  - The program should prompt the user for the name of a text file. 
  - It should verify that the text file exists and if so open it. 
  - If the text file does not exist an error message should be displayed, and a new file name retrieved. This code should continue until a valid file name has been entered.
  - Store the non-duplicate words in an object that is part of the Collections framework.
  - Sample data you can use to test your code (animals.txt) is contained in this repo.
- Insert a comment at the top of the code containing your name, the chapter number, lab number and the date the program was created.
